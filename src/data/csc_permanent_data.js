        "term": "Blockchain",
        "definition": "A continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, inherently making it resistant to modification."

        "definition": "A curve reflecting the rate of improvement in time per piece as more units of an item are made. A planning technique, [this] is particularly useful in project-oriented industries in which new products are frequently phased in. The basis for the [this] calculation is that workers will be able to produce the product more quickly after they get used to making it. Syn.: experience curve, manufacturing progress curve."

        "definition": "A centralized hub that provides an integrated, complete view of data across the end-to-end supply chain. The system allows the supplier to see the requirements and inventory levels at the customer’s site, enhances the ability to get accurate information about supply location and availability, and highlights any potential excess inventory. Similarly, it helps the customer easily identify supply and demand variations and take necessary actions to return excess inventory."

        "term": "Wearable",
        "definition": "A form of technology worn on the body that allows hands-free work by being voice and/or gesture activated. Wearables can be used for a wide variety of activities within a supply chain, including tracking activity levels, distances moved to execute transactions, and even the exact location of workers in the warehouse. Syn.: wearables."
